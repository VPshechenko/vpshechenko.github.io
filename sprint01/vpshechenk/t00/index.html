    <h2><a name="top"></a>"What makes a superhero?"</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
        couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal
            human
            being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or
        a
        fireman could be considered a superhero. <br> For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a
        regular
        police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is
        fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being
        couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
